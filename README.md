# FizzBuzz Solutions

Welcome to the FizzBuzz repository! Here you'll find implementations of the classic FizzBuzz problem in JavaScript and Golang. I'm planning to add more!

## What is FizzBuzz?
FizzBuzz is a common coding interview question where you need to print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Happy coding!
